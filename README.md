A fun project exploring infinity and statistics.

This technical interpretation of the infinite monkey theorem aims at simulating a (slightly overpowered) monkey who repeatedly hits random keys on a typewriter until a specified word has been typed.

Give it a try by issuing

$ cargo run 'word'

to build and run the program, while replacing 'word' with any sequence of English letters. Don't enter too many characters though, otherwise you might end up waiting your entire life for the application to finish.

A few options are available (see -h for more details) and running in release mode is recommended to increase performance.
